## Parts

## Printed parts
![Prusa Slice'd](rotak-nut-tc.png)
* 2 wing nuts.
    * Make them strong ;)
    * PLA+ is good (ordinary PLA should be too) for colder climate (and not left in sun). PETG or ABS might be better for hot climates.
    * I used 5 perimeters, 7 bottom layers and 70% cubic fill with 0.8mm infill line width (the rest with default line width)

## Assembly
* Open bolt hole at the bottom.
* Using M6 bolt, pull M6 nuts to wing nuts.
* Remove original wing nuts, there is thread at the end of bolt to be undone.
* Screw new wing nuts in, washer first if you want to use them.
