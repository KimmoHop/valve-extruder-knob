Hotend fan duct

**NB! Rear part cooler needed, original part cooling cannot be used!**

## Parts
* HE05_tuuletin.stl - fan side
* HE05_poisto.stl - the other side
* HE05_sormisuoja - flimsy fanguard
* HE05_ledin - LED holder
* Rear cooler of your choice

## Assembly
* Print needed parts
* Glue fanguard to fan opening
* Remove hotend cover and cooling fan
* Put 40x10 hotend cooling fan to slot
* Attach fan side to right and the other to left
* Attach rearside part cooler
* LEDs: put 2 LEDs to holes, slide led bar to "knobs" on the sides. Wiring e.g. from hotend cooling fan.
    * LEDs in parallel: 820-1000 ohm resistor in series for both
    * LEDs in series:  560-820 ohm resistor in series
    * LEDs are close so not much current is necessary. More resistance can be used
    * LEDs will likely flicker
