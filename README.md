##root##
Extruder knob for Anycubic i3 Mega

The axle hole is 5.4mm while the axle is 5mm in diameter.
Our printer makes holes ~0.2mm too small on each side, so it fits well. You may have to fiddle with the sizing or pad the flat part with some thin metal.

##duct##
Hotend cooler fan duct for low-power / low-noise Noctua fan.

Uses original screws, does not need the nuts. If necessary, open holes with 2.5mm drill.
**NB!** With 3d-printed hotend cover (2mm walls", the orogonal version did not allow the cover to sit properly. I used hobby knife to original and fixed the model somewhat the same amount. I haven't printed nor tried the fixed version.
